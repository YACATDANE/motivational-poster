    <h1 class="quote">Despite Everything, it's still you.</h1>
    <p class="quote">You look at yourself and remember the amount of mistakes you've made from the beginning. It starts flooding your head to the point all the noise supresses and the ring of silence slowly increases in volume and you can't take it anymore, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts it HURTS!...But suddenly, you face the mirror one last time. You see the kid in yourself enjoying and smiling as they wander around with their hands held high, wondering if you could still be them again. The kid everyone adored and admired, then you remember of those people who helped you in times of need. Maybe you're still the same kid, but matured and wiser than before. Because despite everything, it's still you.</p>
